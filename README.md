Making quasicrystal voxels in Processing

Starting from this sketch: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/704262 I am in the process of writing a voxel 
manipulating / generated terrain game with an aperiodic grid inside of Processing.

I've now switched to Godot for development of the main game. At some point I'd like to keep going with 
this version until it has support for various grids, including some periodic ones such as a rhombic dodecahedron
grid.
